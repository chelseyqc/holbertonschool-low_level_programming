# Script descriptions
[0-isupper](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/0-isupper.c) - A function that checks for an uppercase character and returns `1` if true or `0` if false


[1-isdigit.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/1-isdigit.c) - A function that checks for a digit (`0`through `9`) and turns `1` if true, or `0` if false


[2-mul.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/2-mul.c) - A function that multiplies two integers and returns the result


[3-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/3-print_numbers.c) - A function that prints the numbers from `0` to `9` followed by a newline. Uses `_putchar` only twice


[4-print_most_numbers.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/4-print_most_numbers.c) - A function that prints the numbers from `0` to `9` followed by a new line, except for `2` and `4`. Uses `_putchar` only twice


[5-more_numbers.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/5-more_numbers.c) - A function that prints 10 times the numbers from `0` to `14`, followed by a new line. Uses `_putchar` only three times


[6-print_line.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/6-print_line.c) - A function that draws a straight line in the terminal, where `n` is the number of times `_` should be printed. If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`


[7-print_diagonal.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/7-print_diagonal.c) - A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal, where `n` is the number of times `\` should be printed. If `n` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`


[8-print_square.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/8-print_square.c) - A function that prints a square using `#` followed by a new line, where `size` is the size of the square. If `size` is `0` or less, the function should only print `\n`


[9-fizz_buzz.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/9-fizz_buzz.c) - A program that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. The numbers that are multiples of three, will print `Fizz` instead of the number, and if they are a multiple of five, it will print `Buzz`. For numbers that are mutliples of both three and five, it will print `FizzBuzz`. Each number or word is separated by a space


[10-print_triangle.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/more_functions_nested_loops/10-print_triangle.c) - A function that prints a triangle using `#` followed by a new line, where `size` is the size of the triangle. If `size` is `0` or less, the functiomn should only print `\n`
