# Script descriptions
[0-create_array.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/0-create_array.c) - A function that creates an array of chars and initializes it with a specific char


[1-strdup.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/1-strdup.c) - A function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter. Returns `NULL` if str = `NULL`


[2-str_concat.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/2-str_concat.c) - A function that concatenates two strings, returns a pointer to the newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of `s1`, followed by the contents of `s2`, and null terminated, if `NULL` is passed, treat it as an empty string. The function should return `NULL` on failure


[3-alloc_grid.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/3-alloc_grid.c) - A function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers, each element of the grid should be initialized to `0` and the function should return `NULL` on failure. If `width` or `height` is `0` or negative will return `NULL`


[4-free_grid.c](https://github.com/chelseyqc/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/malloc_free/4-free_grid.c) - A function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by `alloc_grid`
